# tip-caculator
my first android program

This is my first android program, that I learned and developed within 2 weeks. I only tested it on simulator, since I don't have 
an android cellphone. The whole application includes
1)Welcome (First) Screen:It allows the user to enter the bill amount, tip percentage and number of people that will pay
2) Summary Screen: It is displayed after the user prompts the application to calculate the tip amount in the Welcome (First) 
                  screen. It simply lists the bill, tip and total amounts. Optionally, if more than one person is paying, 
                  it displays the amount of money that should be paid by each individual and the tip amount each person 
                  would be paying (tip per person).
3)Settings Menu or Screen: It allows the user to set the default tip percentage and currency. For the default tip percentage 
                  setting, if specified, it would be automatically “auto filled” next time the application is used 
                  (although the user can always change that percentage). For the currency setting, you need to only support 
                  the following currencies: Dollar, Euro and Pound.
4) “Suggest a Tip” Menu or Screen: It allows the user to rate her or his quality of experience at the restaurant through a 
                  five star rating system. Upon rating the experience, a tip percentage is calculated using the following 
                  formula:
                  TipPercentage = 10 + (rating *2)�=10+(𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔×2)
                  where rating is the number of stars out of five specified by the user. The calculated tip percentage is 
                  then displayed to the user as a suggestion.
